Coursework Part 2 – Java Agents Simulation (Contract-Net variant)

1. Overview
This implementation simulates an e-commerce shopping process with autonomous buyer agents and seller agents interacting through a broker agent. Interactions follow a variant of the Contract-Net protocol: the broker issues CFP messages, sellers reply with proposals or refusals, the broker recommends an offer, and the customer (buyer agent) makes the final decision.

2. Agent Roles
- BrokerAgent:
  - Receives an OrderRequest with constraints (price range, quantity, delivery preference).
  - Issues CFP to registered SellerAgents.
  - Collects SellerReply messages (PROPOSE with Offer or REFUSE with a reason).
  - Analyses offers and recommends the best offer using a simple scoring rule.
  - Executes the transaction by sending ACCEPT to the chosen seller and REJECT to others.
- BuyerAgent:
  - Represents a customer profile and initiates a purchase through the broker.
  - Selects the final offer (can differ from broker recommendation, e.g., prefer faster delivery).
- RetailerSellerAgent:
  - Represents a retailer with a local product database/inventory.
  - Validates CFP constraints and produces an Offer or declines.
  - Confirms accepted offers and updates stock.

3. Data Model
- Product: productId, name, unitPrice, stock, deliveryType, estimatedDays
- OrderRequest: productName, quantity, min/max unit price, delivery preference
- Offer: sellerId, productId, productName, unitPrice, deliveryType, estimatedDays
- CustomerProfile: max budget and delivery preferences

4. Contract-Net Interaction Steps (Method Calls)
1) BuyerAgent submits an order to BrokerAgent.
2) BrokerAgent sends CFP to each SellerAgent.
3) Sellers respond with PROPOSE (Offer) or REFUSE (reason).
4) Broker recommends the “best” offer.
5) BuyerAgent makes the final decision and selects an offer.
6) Broker sends ACCEPT to selected seller (REJECT to others).
7) Seller confirms transaction and stock is updated.
8) Console logs show each step and transaction results.

5. Testing / Scenarios
- Laptop purchase with fast delivery preference (demonstrates recommended vs chosen offer).
- Low budget laptop purchase (demonstrates constraint filtering).
- Mouse purchase where one seller refuses due to stock (demonstrates refusals and success).
